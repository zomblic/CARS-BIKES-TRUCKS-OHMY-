  [![Watch the video]](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zomblic/makingacar/main/video/Example.mov)

  
  Let's make a car! Or a truck! Or a motorcycle! Motorbike? Cycle. This create a car generator allows you to create your own car in the style of Zork! ... minus the scary, tiny goblin monster waiting for you at the wrong turn in the forest. 

  Once you decide on the type of automoblile, you'll be able to write your own make/model/year and decide on the color!

  ## <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 255);">Install</span>
  Required tools: VS Code, Git Bash, (I'm assuming you already have github), Node (the most recent version).

  Required Additional Tools: Npm, a Computer (which I'm assuming you already have).

  Required Dependencies: Inquirer (via NPM), TypeScript

  Optional Requirement: Knowledge of basic char information.

  After setting up VScode and Node, navitage to your terminal and type in the code 'npm i'.
  Once installed, type in your terminal "npm start" and just wait a moment as our 'Create a Vroom Vroom' menu appears.

  ## <span style="color:rgb(0, 147, 206);">Usage</span>

  After installing, select between the three already stored vechicles or go ahead and create your own. 
  If choosing to create your own, simply write the answer for each question. You can choose to base it off a real car, or... make it up? I mean, I'm sure there'll be trucks that can one day tow 5,000,000lbs worth of trucks. 

If you choose to go with the premade cars, select the option and choose from the available list. Now, if you created a car, it should spawn there, along with all the information once you click into it. Select an option and you'll open up a menu with several options. You'll be able to start, reserve, turn and stop your car. Not only that, you'll be able to check to see if your car can do a wheelie (for motorcycles/bikes only I'm afraid) or if they can tow (trucks only, for now), or you can decided to 'print' the information and have the information logged into your terminal. The printed option also provides the vin number and wheels, etc.

    To the bootcamp for providing the readme for the assignment,

    Classmates for forming study groups to problem solve and figure it out -- thanks to Clinton R for helping with final leg of  the project and catching the syntax!
    Tutors (Erik for explaining and helping witht he code -- override especially) and TAs for being patient and helping us out,

    Google (and the many, many, many websites that offered advice, tibits and a variety of coding exmaples-- StackOverflow and GeekdforGeeks mainly),

    Co-Pilot for identifying debugging and slightly tweaking (not sure how to succesfully cite debugged code tho)

    And Vs Code!
    
      ... we don't talk about gitbash.
